# mmoryosef.github.io
mmyosef@my.waketech.edu
My GitHub account is currently quite barren. It's a school-only account I'm using for future assignments and presently only has this repository.
This repository has a readme file- and nothing else. I'll hope to add more to it in the future.
I opened the desktop version of git and followed the steps on the guide. I pressed "clone a repository from the internet" and selected "mmoryosef.github.io" from my list.
