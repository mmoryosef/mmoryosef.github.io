My GitHub account is currently quite barren. It's a school-only account I'm using for future assignments and presently only has this repository.
This repository has a readme file- and nothing else. I'll hope to add more to it in the future.
I opened the desktop version of git and followed the steps on the guide. I pressed "clone a repository from the internet" and selected "mmoryosef.github.io" from my list.

# About Me
## My interests.
I love to create music and I love to write code. I spend a lot of my free time writing code and music and will occasionally make small games in engines like Unity with those skills. I'm not much of an artist, but it is fun to try and create assets for those games. I aspire to be a good back-end developer.
